README question:
    Creating a climate change simulator for a planet with just five country and a strict set of policies was a bit easy;
However, a climate change simulator for earth might be a bit harder since there are over 200 countries (all with different policies and emissions),
many different variables that contribute to climate change, and a vast amount of DIFFERENT information regarding climate change.
The best and most feasible way to create a climate change simulator would be to obtain data from a global organization,
such as the United Nations. This data would be the most useful since countries will have to be transparent or sanctions
 from other countries will be placed if they deliberately provide the wrong information. After obtaining the information
 (set of policies the country has towards its emissions and history of the countries emissions)
 we would try to encourage some members of the scientific community to vet and verify that the information is
 unbiased and factual. Afterwards, I would use the information to create an artificial intelligence model (similar
 to this one) that will help predict the future state of climate. After I am sure the model is precise, I would share it
 with members of the scientific community to make sure the model is unbiased, accurate, and logical.
 After the model is vetted, I would share the findings with the members of the united  nations, publish the
 findings to the media. I would continually try to create awareness in order for countries
 to take climate change seriously and create logistical policies that would address the issue. The key difference between
 the simulation we created for the project and the simulation we create for earth is the credibility. The model we create
 for earth needs to be 100% accurate since it would tell us how much time we have until a catastrophic event occurs.The
 model for earth would potentially harm or help millions of people, depending onf its accuracy. Since many politicians
 will use the model to aid their political agenda, the model must demonstrate the most likely scenario, based on
  all the factors contributing to climate change
