Design Check 10/21/2020: Climate Simulator

1)  What state will the simulator need to track?
    Be specific about the data structures you will use to track each piece of state.

    We need to keep track of the present year, the policies for each country (a dictionary), emission for each country
    (a dictionary), the global BAd amount, the country temperatures (a list with a dictionary in the form of
    {'name': 'country name', 'temperature': 'country temperature'} for each country).

2)  Why does each policy’s emit method need to take in the same arguments?
    Think about the implementation of the simulator’s advance_year method.

    Because we call the same method on all policy classes within the advance_year method (polymorphism).

3)  What arguments should the emit methods take?

    emit(baseline, threshold, increment, emission data(BAd ppm), temperature)
